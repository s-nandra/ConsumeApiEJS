# ConsumeApiEJS
post to api with basic auth this the fetches a bearer token.
Use the token for a GET request to fetch customers.

# To get started:
Within the repo directory: 
> npm install
>
> node server
>
> http://localhost:3030


# Summary
> **Time spent:** 1 day working on and off through the weekend.
>
> **Tools used:** postman, bootstrap, node, npm, express server, nodemon and superagent to build the api.
>
> **Issues:** I spent most of my time getting the bearer token to work as this was not being sent properly within the api, I reformatted this and eventually get the authorization to work. 
>
> I have assumed that there are foreign id fields within the customer Person and equipment data which maps to the corresponding customer classes.
