# ConsumeApiEJS
post to api with basic auth this the fetches a bearer token.
Use the token for a GET request to fetch customers.

# To get started:
within the repo directory: npm install
and
node server


# Summary
> **Time spent:** 1 day working on and off through the weekend.

> **Tools used:** postman, bootstrap, node, npm, express server, nodemon and superagent to build the api.

> **Issues:** I spent most of my time getting the bearer token to work as this was not being sent properly within the api, I reformatted this and eventually got the authourization to work. 

> I have assuemed that there are foregign id fields within the customerPerson and equipment data which maps to the corresponding customer classes.
